# OCaml Programming: Solutions

This repo contains solutions to most exercises from the textbook [_OCaml
Programming: Correct + Efficient + Beautiful_][op].

**Fall 2022 beta public release.** This is the first time the solutions have
been made publicly available. Though they have been available to Cornell
students for a few years, it is inevitable that wider circulation will reveal
improvements that could be made.

**Authorship.** Many students and teaching assistants have contributed to these
solutions. The primary maintainer is Michael R. Clarkson.

**Contributions.** We are happy to add or correct solutions. If you find any
errors or missing answers in these solutions, please create a pull request. By
doing so, you are understood to assign copyright to Michael R. Clarkson, and to
agree to the licensing of your contribution under the same terms as the rest of
the solutions.
